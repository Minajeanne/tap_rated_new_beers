Here's the plan:

1. Scrape from BeerAdvocate and collect top 10 NEW beers
2. Display beer: name, brewery, style, abv, ratings, & score
3. Prompt user to select a beer to learn more about it;
    Once selected, individual beer will show: location, url, availability, & notes
4. Run menu again
5. Prompt user to either select another beer or exit
6. Exit message
